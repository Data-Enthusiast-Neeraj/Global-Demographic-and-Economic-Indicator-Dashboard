1. Project Title / Headline
🌍 Global Demographics and Economic Indicators Dashboard (Excel-Based)
An Excel dashboard analyzing world population, GDP, geographic area, and water resources across continents and regions.

2. Short Description / Purpose
This dashboard offers a consolidated view of global indicators—population density, economic growth, territorial size, and water availability—allowing stakeholders to compare and contrast development trends across various continents and regions.

3. Tech Stack
The project was developed using:

📊 Microsoft Excel – Platform for data modeling, charting, and dashboard layout.

📌 Form Controls – Drop-downs for dynamic filtering (e.g., continent and region).

📈 Pivot Tables & Charts – For statistical summaries.

💡 Formulas – Used for calculations (e.g., growth % and top 5 selections).

🧩 Add-ins (Optional) – Heat maps or Power Map for global visualization (unavailable in some versions).

4. Data Source
The dataset comprises publicly available global statistics, likely compiled from sources such as:

World Bank

United Nations

IMF
It includes the following fields:

Country, Population, GDP, Area (sq. km), Water Resource Volume, Growth %, Continent, Region

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Governments and researchers need a comparative analysis of countries' development indicators for policy planning and resource management.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a user-friendly dashboard for analyzing:

Most populous countries

Largest countries by area

Countries with highest GDP and economic growth

Water resource distribution by GDP

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
Continent & Region Filters (Left Pane): Interactive slicers for dynamic regional analysis
